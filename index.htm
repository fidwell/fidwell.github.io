        <p>I'm Andrew, sometimes known as "fidwell" on the Internet. I make silly things.
            Here's a collection of some of the things I've made.</p>

            <h2>Where to find me</h2>

            <h3>Major socials</h3>

            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/fidwell">YouTube</a> &ndash; Mostly RollerCoaster
                Tycoon-related things: tutorials, park builds, some speedruns. A couple vlogs too.</p>
            <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/AeGmtrBhnW">Discord</a> &ndash; Casual hangouts;
                mostly populated by my Twitch audience, but all are welcome.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fidwell/">Twitch</a> &ndash; From 2020 to 2023 I streamed twice
                weekly, usually RollerCoaster Tycoon but also some other retro and indie games. I might still
                be on there every once in a while.</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm an enterprise software developer living in Columbus, Ohio.</p>

            <h3>Monetization policy</h3>

            <p>I hate ads and I think they make the world a worse place. All of my projects here are
                hobbies and should stay that way. So, nothing I do is monetized. Twitch is an
                exception since the platform basically makes you do it, but all proceeds I make
                there are donated to various charities and GitHub sponsorships.
