    <h1>FidHub</h1>

    <p>I'm Andrew, sometimes known as "fidwell" on the Internet. I make silly things.
        Here's a collection of some of the silly things I've made.</p>
    <p>(Sometimes I make not-silly things too but only because my job pays me to do so,
        so I don't have any of that listed here.)</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <a href="./rct/index.htm">RollerCoaster Tycoon / OpenRCT2 related things</a>

    <h2>External links</h2>

    <h3>Major socials</h3>

    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/fidwell"><strong>YouTube</strong></a> &ndash; Mostly RollerCoaster
        Tycoon-related things: tutorials, park builds, some speedruns. A couple vlogs too.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fidwell/"><strong>Twitch</strong></a> &ndash; From 2020 to 2023 I streamed twice
        weekly, usually RollerCoaster Tycoon but also some other retro and indie games. I'm still
        on there every once in a while.</p>
    <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/AeGmtrBhnW"><strong>Discord</strong></a> &ndash; Casual hangouts;
        mostly populated by my Twitch audience, but all are welcome.</p>

    <h3>Places of lesser interest</h3>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/fidwell/">GitHub</a> &bull; <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~fidwell">RateYourMusic</a>
    &bull; <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/user/fidwell">Speedrun.com</a> &bull;
    <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/fidwell/">Steam</a></p>

    <h2>Monetization policy</h2>

    <p>I hate ads and I think they make the world a worse place. All of my projects here are
        hobbies and should stay that way. So, nothing I do is monetized. Twitch is an
        exception since the platform basically makes you do it, but all proceeds I make
        there are donated to various charities.
